# 🚀 ULTRATHINK Remaining Test Phases (Post-Integration)

**Status:** Deferred pending Component Integration Fix  
**Created:** 2025-01-08  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing strategy for the REAL ULTRATHINK component-based architecture

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** These phases will be executed AFTER the Component Integration Fix is complete.  
> Currently, Connect4UINew uses inline implementation instead of ULTRATHINK components.  
> Testing the inline architecture would be irrelevant for ULTRATHINK validation.
