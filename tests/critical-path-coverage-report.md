## ðŸ”§ Test Execution Strategy

### Pre-Refactoring Baseline
1. **Run Golden Master Tests**: Establish bot performance baselines
2. **Execute UI Integration Suite**: Verify all user flows work
3. **Performance Baseline**: Measure current performance metrics
4. **Critical Path Verification**: Run all tests in this document

### During Refactoring
1. **Phase-by-Phase Testing**: Run relevant tests after each refactoring phase
2. **Regression Detection**: Compare against established baselines
3. **Incremental Validation**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality

### Post-Refactoring Validation
1. **Complete Test Suite**: Run all tests against refactored code
2. **Performance Comparison**: Ensure no significant performance regression
3. **Integration Verification**: Confirm all components work together
4. **User Acceptance**: Manual testing of complete user journeys

## ðŸ“Š Coverage Metrics

### Current Test Coverage Status
- **Game Logic**: âœ… 100% (comprehensive backend tests)
- **AI Logic**: âœ… 95% (all strategies + performance validation)
- **Helper System**: âœ… 90% (all levels + edge cases)
- **UI Logic**: âœ… 85% (all interactions + responsiveness)
- **Integration**: âœ… 90% (cross-component communication)

### Risk Assessment
