/**
 * DEPRECATED: Pure JavaScript AI Logic Removed
 * 
 * This file previously contained the JavaScript implementation of Gobang AI.
 * As per project requirements, ALL game logic (including AI) must now be implemented in Rust/WASM.
 * 
 * The AI logic is now exclusively available through:
 * - Enhanced AI in js/ai-enhanced.js (WASM-powered)
 * - Rust implementation in game_engine/src/lib.rs
 * 
 * This ensures consistent architecture where:
 * - Rust/WASM handles ALL strategic analysis and move generation
 * - JavaScript handles ONLY UI integration and AI coordination
